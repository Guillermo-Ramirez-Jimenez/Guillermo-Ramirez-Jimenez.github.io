# Camera Keychain reverse engineering

Lately, I found a curious gadget long forgotten at home. It's a keychain, but holds a camera inside! There's a microSD card slot and a microphone too.

Unfortunately, the case was damaged and looks like some electronic components were lost. I've not tried to power it on, anyway.

Looking on the net I found it is known as one of the variants of the 808 Car Keys Micro Camera. There's more information on this site: [Link](https://www.chucklohr.com/808/C10/index.html)
